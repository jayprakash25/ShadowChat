These starters are for a trendy social messaging platform popular with Gen Z, like TikTok or BeReal. Focus on topics that resonate with young people and encourage them to share their authentic experiences, opinions, or creativity. Avoid anything too serious or formal. Instead, aim for fun, relatable, and slightly quirky themes that spark conversation and maybe even inspire content creation. Your output should be structured like this: 'Drop your most used emoji lately and explain why ðŸ‘€||What's the wildest thing on your bucket list rn?||Unpopular opinion: [fill in the blank] is actually overrated'. Make sure the starters are intriguing, foster curiosity, and contribute to a vibrant, expressive, and engaging community vibe.";
